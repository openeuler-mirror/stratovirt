//! This module implements a simple way to realize QMP.
//!
//! # Qmp Introduction
//!
//! [Qmp](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/QMP) is a Json-based protocol
//! which allows applications to control a VM instance.
//! It has three feature:
//! 1. Qmp server is no-async service as well as Qemu's.
//!    Command + events can replace asynchronous command.
//! 2. Qmp server can only be connected a client at one time.
//!    It's no situation where be communicated with many clients.
//!    When it must use, can use other communication way not QMP.
//! 3. Qmp's message structure base is transformed by scripts from Qemu's
//!    `qmp-schema.json`. It's can be compatible by Qemu's zoology. Those
//!    transformed structures can be found in `machine_manager/src/qmp/qmp_schema.rs`
