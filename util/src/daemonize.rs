//!
//! # Daemonize Introduction
//!
//! [daemonize](https://linux.die.net/man/1/daemonize) to runs a command as a
//! Unix daemonize. A daemon is a process that executes in the background either
//! waiting for some event to occur, or waiting to perform some specified task
//! on a periodic basis. A typical daemon program will:
//! 1. Close all open file descriptors(especially standard input, standard
//! output and standard error).
//! 2. Change its working directory to the root filesystem, to ensure that it
//! doesn't tie up another filesystem and prevent it from being unmounted.
//! 3. Reset its umask value.
//! 4. Run in the background(i.e., fork).
//! 5. Ignore all terminal I/O signals.
//! 6. Disassociate from the control terminal.
//! 7. Disassociate from its process group, to insulate itself from signals
//! sent to the process group.
//! 8. Handle any `SIGCLD` signals.
